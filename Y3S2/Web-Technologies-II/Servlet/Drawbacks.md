## **Drawbacks of Java Servlets**

### 1. **Scalability Limitations**

* **Problem**: Handling complex logic and presentation in a single `HttpServlet` class leads to **monolithic code**.
* **Explanation**: Mixing business logic, control logic, and HTML generation results in poor separation of concerns, violating **MVC principles**.

---

### 2. **Maintenance Complexity**

* **Problem**: HTML is embedded in Java code via `out.println(...)`.
* **Explanation**: This makes the code difficult to **read**, **modify**, and **debug**—especially for web designers or frontend developers unfamiliar with Java.

---

### 3. **Poor Separation of Concerns**

* **Problem**: Servlet code handles multiple responsibilities.
* **Explanation**: Violates **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** — UI rendering, business logic, and HTTP handling are all intermingled.

---

### 4. **No Built-in Templating**

* **Problem**: Lack of view templating engine (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf).
* **Explanation**: Output must be manually constructed via string concatenation, which is error-prone.

---

### 5. **Thread Safety Issues**

* **Problem**: A single servlet instance serves multiple requests concurrently.
* **Explanation**: Shared member variables must be accessed carefully. **Race conditions** can occur if synchronization is mishandled.

---

### 6. **Difficult to Reuse Code**

* **Problem**: Reusability of code is low.
* **Explanation**: Tight coupling between request processing and business logic reduces modularity.

---

### 7. **No State Management by Default**

* **Problem**: HTTP is stateless.
* **Explanation**: Developers must manually implement session tracking via **cookies**, **URL rewriting**, or **HttpSession**.

---

### 8. **Lack of Built-in Security**

* **Problem**: No built-in features for:

  * Authentication/Authorization
  * Input validation
* **Explanation**: These must be manually implemented or configured in the web container.

---

### 9. **Limited Productivity**

* **Problem**: Low-level API, verbose syntax.
* **Explanation**: Writing raw servlets is time-consuming compared to using frameworks like **Spring MVC** or **JSF**.

---

### 10. **Harder to Test**

* **Problem**: Servlets are tied to the servlet container.
* **Explanation**: Unit testing requires mock objects or embedded containers, increasing complexity.

| Drawback              | Why It's a Problem                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Poor maintainability  | HTML in Java code is hard to update         |
| No MVC structure      | No separation between logic/view/controller |
| Difficult scalability | Code becomes tightly coupled and bloated    |
| No templating support | Hard to generate complex UIs                |
| Thread-safety issues  | Shared data must be synchronized            |
| Stateless protocol    | Manual session management required          |
