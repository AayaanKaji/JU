ASSIGNMENT â€“ 3
 (SOCKET Programming)





IPC using SOCKET							(10 Marks) [CO5]

Create two processes.
Transfer 1GB file from parent to child using a Socket.
Now, transfer the same file from child to parent using the same Socket. 

Now, the parent process should compare the two files to make sure that the same file has returned back. 

Also, print the time required to do this double transfer. 
Attach this output to the source file as a comment.

Please note that, you can see the socket which your program creates. 
There are also various bash shell commands available to see the sockets created by the program. 
So, once your program creates the socket, make sure you use proper command to see the socket info and paste that output as a comment in your source file.
